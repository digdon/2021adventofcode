# Day 23: Amphipod

Far too complicated for me, even after reading a ton of Reddit solutions - I understood that basic Dijkstra would solve the problem, but I just couldn't figure out how to calculate each set of moves to examine with Dijkstra. As such, I cheated and used this as an opportunity to play with some AI stuff - ChatGPT, in this case.

I was quite impressed with ChatGPT came up with. Even with all of the copying of arrays and such, part 1 still only takes about 140ms. Part 2 takes about half that time. I will spend a few hours studying the code so that I understand where the gap is in my abilities so that I can properly tackle this in the future.
